#My Introduction

**My name is Khizer Sheikh**
*I am a student at FAST karachi, prior to this I was a student at Nixor College and prior to that I was a student at Springfield School.*
*Alongside being a full-time student, I am also a full-time cat person, even though I am allergic to them. But as they say, forbidden fruit tastes the sweetest, the companionship is worth the anti-allergies I have to take.*
A person comes in all shapes and sizes, with multitudes of likes and dislikes. My shape is lean, my size:tall. 
My interests include (but are not limited to): 
-Philosophy 
-Football
-Comics(mainly spider-man)
-problem solving 

My dislikes include:
-fragile objects





**Here's me with a spark in my eyes, which I've been warned will die out during these four years:** ![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/6797b38a-9a10-473d-ac50-a961b6a16715)
